## Inspiration
Onboarding to a new company, project or team can be very time consuming for one reason. "Where do I find this information?" Pointer aims to solve that problem by providing a buddy you could ask anything about your company to, who always searches your sources and provides an answer.

## What it does
Pointer is a powerful tool designed to help you find information within your company from connected accounts like GitHub, Google Drive, Notion and more. It allows you to ask questions to an AI to search for and retrieve information across your organization. You can also view your past searches, connect your corporate accounts, share responses, and manage your user session. Pointer will point you in the right direction for any questions you have about your companyâ€™s documentation. Given the popularity and effectiveness of chatbots, Pointer will also ensure that your data is stored securely and promote better file management and security.

## How we built it
Created an MVP displaying the front-end implementation and core functionality of the app including search functionality using one GitHub Repo, history from each session, and pages to display user flow.

## Challenges we ran into
Working with displaying markdown in the AI response and imitating the base functionality without having to program all the complexities (connect and parsing from multiple sources and securely storing data).

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Creating a working MVP on the first day.

## What we learned
How to differentiate from competitors and create an impressive MVP with minimal technological development.

## What's next for Pointer
A complete product that effectively uses RAG, connects and updates information from multiple sources, and stores company data using Pinecone. Authentication to work with multiple companies.
